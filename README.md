# Identifying-Low-Risk-Aircraft-For-A-Strong-Start-In-Aviation

## Overview
In this project, a comprehensive risk assessment has been conducted to identify low-risk aircraft options for commercial and private operations

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholders
- **The Executive**: Responsible for the long-term benefits and financial risks associated with the Industry
- **The Head of Aviation**: Responsible for operationalizing the expansion into the aviation industry and for the day-to-day logistics
- **The Finance Team**: Responsible for ensuring financial sustainability
- **The Legal Team**:Will focus on the regulatory requirements and risk mitigation in the aviation sector

### Key Business Questions
- Which aircraft has the lowest risk based on the accident history?
- What are the risks associated with accidents?
- How can the company use past data to make informed decisions about aircraft acquisition?

## Data Understanding and Data Analysis

### Source of Data
This project uses data from **National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB) Aviation Accident Database** that includes aviation accident data from 1962-2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. The data can be accessed publicly from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)

### Data Description
This dataset includes attributes such as:
- The weather at the time of the incident.
- The location of where the accident took place.
- The Make of the aircraft.
- The country of occurrence.
- The type of investigation that was carried out.

## Visualizations
- A bar graph showing models with the highest and lowest accidents.
- A pie chart showing the breakdown of accidents by weather.
- A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of engines and fatal injuries.[View the presentation](https://github.com/Kipchumba254/Identifying-Low-Risk-Aircraft-For-A-Strong-Start-In-Aviation/blob/main/presentation.pdf.pdf)




## Conclusion

### Summary of Conclusions Including Three Relevant Findings
- Aircraft models with fewer engines are associated with higher risks in adverse weather.
- Accidents majorly occur during landing and takeoff.
- Aircraft models with single engines should be avoided in places with harsh weather conditions.
